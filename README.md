Codes that I wrote in my MS thesis 

This repo contains the following:
[1] the Mathematica code that I prepared to check the Feynman rules available in the literature.
[2] my LanHEP code to derive the Feynman rules in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge
    with the maximum KK numbers 1, 2, 4, and 6 for the complete MUED Lagrangian.
    
The usage of the Mathematica code is described in the notebook file. 
To run the LanHEP code, one apparently needs the LanHEP package prepared by A. Pukhov.
